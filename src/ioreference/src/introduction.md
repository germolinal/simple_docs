# `SIMPLE` - Simulating for People


Thanks for your interest in `SIMPLE` a simulation tool aiming to 
satisfy the present needs of Building Performance Simulation. In very simple 
terms, **`SIMPLE` is developed by acknowledging that current Building Science 
has to see people as its first priority**. You can read more about this in the ["Do we need `SIMPLE`? section"](what_is_simple.md#do-we-need-simple?)

It is really exciting to have you here. I hope this book—and `SIMPLE` itself—are of your interest. There is a lot to do but it surely has a lot of potential!

## What to expect from this book?

For now this book has two parts: 

1. **User guide**: This part is written manually, and it is meant to help you learn and understand `SIMPLE`. This part is mainly focused on users. For example, (in the future) it might help you migrate from other tools—if you wanted to—, to understand best building-modelling practices, and so on. If you are looking for information regarding math and equations, then you'd better be looking at the developer documentation (e.g., [this](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/model/struct.ThermalModel.html#method.calculate_zones_abc)). The developer documentation is meant not only for people who want to code but also for people who want to understand the internals of `SIMPLE`.
2. **Input/Output Reference guide**: This is an automatically generated guide, is updated every time the source code of `SIMPLE`'s input model is updated. This section is meant to be a reference guide, helping

## What about Engineering Documentation?

If you are interested in the internals of `SIMPLE`, you should look at the Developer Documentation in [`SIMPLE`'s repositories](https://github.com/SIMPLE-BuildingSimulation). This documentation is not only meant for developers, but also for anyone who wants to understand the math behind `SIMPLE` and, of course, the computer code that represents it (e.g., [this](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/model/struct.ThermalModel.html#method.calculate_zones_abc)). **If you think some documentation is missing, let me know through a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SIMPLE-BuildingSimulation)** (I am happy to hear about more streamlined way of communication).
