<pre><code>       [SIM]ulating

</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for your interest in <code>SIMPLE</code>, a simulation tool aiming to
satisfy the present needs of Building Performance Simulation. Long story short,
<code>SIMPLE</code> aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow for a holistic building performance simulation using best-practice
algorithms for each domain</li>
<li>Make it easier to account for the complex interactions between Humans
and Buildings</li>
<li>Make it possible to implement complex algorithms, such as Model Predictive Control.</li>
<li>Be deployable in multiple environments, including Windows, Linux and Mac, the cloud, the browser (i.e., WebAssembly)</li>
<li>Use modern languages, toolset, and aim for clarity of source code (I do my best...)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about this in the
<a href="what_is_simple.html#do-we-need-simple?">"Do we need <code>SIMPLE</code>? section"</a></p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-this-book"><a class="header" href="#what-to-expect-from-this-book">What to expect from this book?</a></h2>
<p>For now this book has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User guide</strong>: This part is written manually, and it is meant to help you learn and understand <code>SIMPLE</code>. This part is mainly focused on users. For example, (in the future) it might help you migrate from other tools—if you wanted to—, to understand best building-modelling practices, and so on. If you are looking for information regarding math and equations, then you'd better be looking at the developer documentation (e.g., <a href="https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/model/struct.ThermalModel.html#method.calculate_zones_abc">this</a>). The developer documentation is meant not only for people who want to code but also for people who want to understand the internals of <code>SIMPLE</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Input/Output Reference guide</strong>: This is an automatically generated guide, is updated every time the source code of <code>SIMPLE</code>'s input model is updated. This section is meant to be a reference guide, helping</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-simple"><a class="header" href="#what-is-simple">What is <code>SIMPLE</code>?</a></h1>
<p>I think <code>SIMPLE</code> can be seen from two perspectives. One of them is <strong>historical</strong>, and refers
to the motivations and drivers that determined its design and motivated me to develop it. And the other one is
<strong>pragmatic</strong>, refering to those cool features and benefits of <code>SIMPLE</code> that I have been finding <em>during</em> it's
development. (Arguibly, these pragmatic benefits might be present in any modern simulation tool... but considering
the low number of these, I guess they are pretty unique to <code>SIMPLE</code> anyway.)</p>
<h2 id="simples-historical-origins-its-the-people-stupid"><a class="header" href="#simples-historical-origins-its-the-people-stupid"><code>SIMPLE</code>'s historical origins: It's the people, stupid</a></h2>
<p>The development of <code>SIMPLE</code> was motivated by the results of my <a href="https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Exploring_modelling_and_simulating_the_Feeling_of_Comfort_in_residential_settings/17085467/1">PhD Research</a>.
In these studies, I investigated what is it that people—not building scientists
or architects or engineers—mean by and expect from <em>a comfortable home</em>. My finidings
revealed to me how imbalanced our knowledge is, and how this disparity will continue to grow in the future
if we do not dedicate more time to humans. Let me put it as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Materials have been/will be getting better</strong>: e.g., Whether a window is open or closed makes a big different
to the building's performance, and the health and comfort of the people in it.</li>
<li><strong>Software have been/will be getting better</strong>: e.g., We can predict and understand the effects of an open/closed window better than ever before</li>
<li><strong>Our understanding of people is not catching up</strong>: e.g., do we <em>really</em> know whether the window open or closed?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PLEASE Note</strong>: Point 3 is not meant to say that nothing has been done about understanding people. However,
I would argue that our current tools to study people are not the best. This should be more clear later in this section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a problem because buildings are built for people. Therefore, not understanding people implies not understanding the performance of buildings. Understanding <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> people choose to open
windows requires tools that will let us properly research and evaluate human comfort
and behaviour.</p>
<p>Below are the three main elements of <code>SIMPLE</code> that make it better at simulating buildings
for real people.</p>
<h3 id="1-it-was-designed-to-allow-for-holistic-simulations"><a class="header" href="#1-it-was-designed-to-allow-for-holistic-simulations">1. It was designed to allow for holistic simulations</a></h3>
<p>The motivation for performing holistic simulations is kind of obvious: when people get into a room, they just
<em>feel</em> it. In other words, <strong>people do not separate—as software and building scientists do—the
Thermal from the Daylight from the Acoustic domains</strong>. This means that,
if we want to trully incorporate people's behaviour and comfort into our simulations, we need to account
for multiple domains at the same time, <strong>at run time</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>At run time means</strong> that it is not enough to run three simulations (one for thermal, one for acoustic, one for
lighting)  without considering the interaction between these domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> was designed to allow for this. In order to achieve this, we developed an architecture where different modules would connect to a single—domain agnostic—api. This API is the <code>SIMPLE Model</code>, and it allows any developer to say <em>"Hey, give me the temperature of this room"</em> without knowing <em>how</em> this value was calculated. In a similar manner, it allows these developers to make available values for other modules to use.</p>
<p><img src="./images/holistic_architecture.png" alt="SIMPLE&#39;s architecture" /></p>
<h3 id="2-it-was-designed-to-give-some-room-for-peoples-lives"><a class="header" href="#2-it-was-designed-to-give-some-room-for-peoples-lives">2. It was designed to give some room for people's lives</a></h3>
<p>People are not simple. They do not just say <em>"it is cold, I will turn the heater on"</em>
in a deterministic manner. They take into account things like budget, bills, whether
they are alone, and whether they have kids. Modelling this kind of
behaviour calls for a much more flexible way of modelling control algorithms (yes, I am
treating human behaviour as a control algorithm).</p>
<p>This is actually addressed in the same way as point 1 (i.e., Holistic simulations), in the sense that a new module could be created to deal with "Budget" or "Safety" and then use the same API to read and write values.</p>
<h3 id="3-it-was-designed-to-travel-in-time"><a class="header" href="#3-it-was-designed-to-travel-in-time">3. It was designed to travel in time</a></h3>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> was designed with the purpose of acknowledging that <strong>people are constantly aware of their future</strong>.
This is kind of obvious (e.g., you put a jacket <em>before</em> going out, not after) but our simulation tools tend
not to do this at all. This is also not trivial to implement, as it means that people—every time they need to decide what to do—consider the near future that is comming.</p>
<p>From a simulation perspective, this implies</p>
<ol>
<li>gathering a bunch of potential actions to take</li>
<li>mentally implementing that change and simulating some time into the future</li>
<li>identify the best decision to take, if any.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./images/time_traveling.png" alt="Time traveling" /></p>
<p>The way <code>SIMPLE</code> deal with this is by separating the <code>Simulation State</code> (i.e., the values that are part of state of the simulation and <em>NOT</em> temporary) from the model. From a software perspective, the structure representing the model is <em>immutable</em>, and thererfore the simulation process implies changing a <em>mutable</em> element we call the state.</p>
<p>This makes it much easier and computationally cheaper to, <strong>during a simulation</strong>, copy, simulate, and decide which is the best option to take.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-people"><a class="header" href="#beyond-people">Beyond people</a></h2>
<p>First, it is important to acknowledge the benefits of the features outlined above, even if you do not agree with my views on comfort:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Holistic simulations</strong> lets us optimize
multi-domain control algorithms that might lead to more optimal performance of buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Traveling in time</strong> allows us to implement Model Predictive Control, at runtime, in production, as part of a real EMS system.</li>
</ol>
<p>But there are also other benefits.</p>
<h3 id="it-allows-for-more-complex-control-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#it-allows-for-more-complex-control-algorithms">It allows for more complex control algorithms</a></h3>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> allows writing control algorithms as scripts. This allows for a much richer and flexible way of writing algoritghms than through schedules. or other common methodss.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">let kids_bedroom = space("Kids Bedroom");
let kids_heater = hvac("Kids heater");

let temperature = kids_bedroom.dry_bulb_temperature;

if temperature &lt; 18 {
    kids_heater.power_consumption = 1000
} else if temperature &gt; 23 {
    if rand() &gt; 0.82 {        
        kids_heater.power_consumption = 0
    } else {
        print("Oh oh! I forgot to turn the heater off!")
    }
}


</code></pre>
<h3 id="programs-no-longer-just-run-on-your-pc"><a class="header" href="#programs-no-longer-just-run-on-your-pc">Programs no longer just run on your PC</a></h3>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> is a modern tool, written in a modern language, and that can run in
multiple environments.</p>
<p>It can be easily compiled for Windows, Mac and Linux for running locally in your
computer. It can also be compiled into Web Assembly, which means that it can <a href="http://buildingsforpeople.org/simple_demo/">run
on a browser</a> without the need for
servers. It can also be deployed in <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless">very small and secure containers</a>
for running at scale on the cloud. It can probably (I have not tested this) be
compiled into a small computer and be implemented as an Energy Management System in
an actual building, providing insights on what the best strategy is.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cant-we-just-improve-other-tools"><a class="header" href="#cant-we-just-improve-other-tools">Can't we just improve other tools?</a></h1>
<p>I have been working in Building Simulation Tool space for nearly a decade now. During
this time, I have tried to combine simulation tools and methods, and also to make
simulation more accessible to people. For example, my MSc research focused on the
integration of Radiance and EnergyPlus. It was then when I started developing <a href="www.groundhoglighting.com">Groundhog</a>, which intended to put Radiance in everyone’s hands. While
developing Groundhog I realized that Radiance could use some sort of wrapper to make it a
bit friendlier by offering out-of-the-box optimizations and pre- and post-processing.
This motivated me to develop Emp, a Radiance orchestrator. Both projects—Radiance and
Emp—have already died for various reasons.</p>
<p>During my time developing building performance simulation tools I have learned about an
enormous amount of undeniable virtues that currently available tools—e.g., EnergyPlus and
Radiance—have: they have been extensively validated, they are open source, they are free
(as in freedom), and so on. Unfortunately, I have also seen many drawbacks. For starters,
these tools were not really meant to be embedded on other tools. Radiance confesses this
quite clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These routines are designed to aid the programmer who wishes to call Radiance as a
library.  Unfortunately, the system was not originally intended to be run this way, and
there are some awkward limitations to contend with…” (Radiance’s raycalls.c)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, these tools were developed decades ago. Radiance was developed before the gaming
and animation industry invested millions in improving rendering techniques, and
EnergyPlus tends to focus too much on building physics even if we now know that we need
to pay more attention to people’s behaviour in buildings (because insulating an open door
is pointless). Also, programming was different back then, with different source control
systems and way less people who knew how to code.</p>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> attempts to fix these issues by being open-source from day zero, by using a
modern programming language, by having an architeture designed for enabling
collaboration. Don’t be mistaken, though, <code>SIMPLE</code> does not attempt to reinvent the
wheel. The real wheel is the knowledge of physics and rendering and computer sciences
behind currently existing Building Performance Simulation tools… what it proposes is to
build a good-old wheel with new materials and methods, in a more modern factory, and that
is designed to travel in modern roads.</p>

<p><code>SIMPLE</code> is an incredible tool that performs Building Performance Simulations efficiently. While it requires occasion interactions with the terminal and code, we have made this guide very simple for beginners. Throughout, you will learn how the tool works, how to prepare input files and analyze outputs.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-simple-simulation"><a class="header" href="#running-a-simple-simulation">Running a <code>SIMPLE</code> Simulation</a></h2>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> is a command-line based tool, therefore, it doesn't have a user interface (UI). Here’s a short crash course on how the terminal works:</p>
<p>The terminal is an interface that allows you to access the command line. The command line is a text-based interface within the operating system to control the software.</p>
<p>To run <code>SIMPLE</code>, you will use the terminal to navigate to the folder where your <code>SIMPLE</code> executable file is located. This can be done by executing a sequence of <code>cd</code> (change directory) commands.</p>
<p>Once you are in the correct directory, you can call <code>SIMPLE</code> and start a simulation. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">simple -i model.spl -w weather_file.epw -n 1 -o results.csv
</code></pre>
<p>In this command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-i</code> stands for input, followed by the name of your model file (in this case, <code>model.spl</code>).</li>
<li><code>-w</code> is used to specify the weather file (here, <code>weather_file.epw</code>).</li>
<li><code>-n 1</code> defines the timestep, which is used to report variables and control the building.</li>
<li><code>-o</code> is used to define the output file (<code>results.csv</code> in this case).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-building-model"><a class="header" href="#the-building-model">The Building Model</a></h2>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> uses a text file as its primary input. This file describes a model, which can contain multiple buildings, although it is most common to simulate just one. (Describing the building in single-building simulations might hel[] estimate some things, like air leakage, based on the number of stories.)</p>
<p>A <code>SIMPLE</code> model contains—among others—the following elements (a more accurate and detailed list is available in the Input/Output reference)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spaces</strong>: Basically, volumes of air that will have a single temperature. Each of them becomes a single Thermal Zone.</li>
<li><strong>Buildings</strong>: Can contain Spaces</li>
<li><strong>Surfaces</strong>: Physical elements—of a certain <code>Material</code>—that receive sun, transmit heat, and separate spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Substances</strong>: A substance with a set of physical properties (e.g., density)</li>
<li><strong>Materials</strong>: A layer of a certain thickness made up of a certain <code>Substance</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructions</strong>: A set of <code>Materials</code></li>
<li><strong>Hvacs</strong>: Heaters, Air Conditioners and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Luminaires</strong>: Elements made for lighting. They produce light and also heat.</li>
<li><strong>Objects</strong>: Mostly decorative at the moment (i.e., they do not interfere in simulation results), this is furniture, toiletes and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Site Details</strong>: Describes the site and environment in which the model is located.</li>
<li><strong>Outputs</strong>: Describe the outputs we want to be reported.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="describing-a-model"><a class="header" href="#describing-a-model">Describing a model</a></h2>
<p>A <code>SIMPLE</code> model can be written in a <code>.spl</code> or <code>.json</code> file. The <code>.spl</code> format is meant to be more human-readable. (<code>.json</code> files are meant to be read and written by machines, mostly).</p>
<p>A <code>.spl</code> file starts by identifying the object type (e.g., <code>SiteDetails</code> or <code>Substance</code>) followed by a set of corresponding properties of the object being described.</p>
<p>Comments can be added with <code>//</code> for single lines and <code>/*... */</code> for multi lines.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample basic model written in <code>.spl</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">// This is a single line comment
/*
Comments can have multiple lines
So you can explain thigs better:

1. By adding lists
2. And longer comments.

*/

// This describes the environment of the model
SiteDetails {
   altitude : 0.0, // it is at sea level
   terrain : "City", // in a city
   latitude : -41.0, // at this latitude
   longitude : 174.0,  // at this loingitude
   standard_meridian : 180.0,  // this defines the timezone, basically
}

// This describes a building
Building {
    name: "Art Deco Building",
    n_storeys: 2, // it has 2 storeys
    shelter_class: "Urban",  // It is shelter as you would expect in a city
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="asking-for-output"><a class="header" href="#asking-for-output">Asking for output</a></h2>
<p>You can request specific outputs to be included in the results. This is done with an <code>Output</code> keyword followed by the desired output and an identifier. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">Output {
    SpaceDryBulbTemperature : "Kids Bedroom" // Report the Dry Bulb Temperature of the Kids Bedroom.
}
</code></pre>
