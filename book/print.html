<pre><code>       [SIM]ulating

</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for your interest in <code>SIMPLE</code>, a simulation tool aiming to
satisfy the present needs of Building Performance Simulation. Long story short,
<code>SIMPLE</code> aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow for a holistic building performance simulation using best-practice
algorithms for each domain</li>
<li>Make it easier to account for the complex interactions between Humans
and Buildings</li>
<li>Make it possible to implement complex algorithms, such as Model Predictive Control.</li>
<li>Be deployable in multiple environments, including Windows, Linux and Mac, the cloud, the browser (i.e., WebAssembly)</li>
<li>Use modern languages, toolset, and aim for clarity of source code (I do my best...)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about this in the
<a href="what_is_simple.html#do-we-need-simple?">"Do we need <code>SIMPLE</code>? section"</a></p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-this-book"><a class="header" href="#what-to-expect-from-this-book">What to expect from this book?</a></h2>
<p>For now this book has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User guide</strong>: This part is written manually, and it is meant to help you learn and understand <code>SIMPLE</code>. This part is mainly focused on users. For example, (in the future) it might help you migrate from other tools—if you wanted to—, to understand best building-modelling practices, and so on. If you are looking for information regarding math and equations, then you'd better be looking at the developer documentation (e.g., <a href="https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/model/struct.ThermalModel.html#method.calculate_zones_abc">this</a>). The developer documentation is meant not only for people who want to code but also for people who want to understand the internals of <code>SIMPLE</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Input/Output Reference guide</strong>: This is an automatically generated guide, is updated every time the source code of <code>SIMPLE</code>'s input model is updated. This section is meant to be a reference guide, helping</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-simple"><a class="header" href="#what-is-simple">What is <code>SIMPLE</code>?</a></h1>
<p>The development of <code>SIMPLE</code> was motivated by the results of my <a href="https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Exploring_modelling_and_simulating_the_Feeling_of_Comfort_in_residential_settings/17085467/1">PhD Research</a>.
In these studies, I investigated what is it that people—not building scientists
or architects or engineers—mean by and expect from <em>a comfortable home</em>. My finidings
revealed to me how little we know about human behaviour in buildings, compared to
building physics.</p>
<p>Building science has improved massively in recent years. On the one hand, windows, doors,
and construction materials have become better at keeping us comfortable and healthy;
and on the other hand, software has become more powerful, accessible, and easier to use.
This means two things. First, that keeping a window open or closed makes a big difference
in a building performance; and also, that we can predict and understand the physical
effects of said open (or closed) window better than ever... and yet, is this window open
or closed?</p>
<p>You see, buildings are made for people, and not understanding people means we do not
understand the performance of buildings. Understanding <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> people choose to open
windows requires tools that will let us properly research and evaluate human comfort
and behaviour.</p>
<p>While creating a tool for reseraching and evaluating human behaviour and comfort
was the origin of <code>SIMPLE</code>, the objectives of this project also include other factors
related to the modernization of building performance simulation. Let me ellaborate:</p>
<h2 id="we-need-holistic-simulation-tools"><a class="header" href="#we-need-holistic-simulation-tools">We need holistic simulation tools</a></h2>
<p>The reason for this is trivial: when people get into a room, they just
<em>feel</em> it. They do not separate—as Software and building scientists do—the
Thermal from the Daylight from the Acoustic domains. So,<code>SIMPLE</code> aims to enable
holistic Building Performance Simulation. Therefore, if we want to trully incorporate
people's behaviour and comfort, we need to account for multiple domains at the
same time, <strong>at run time</strong> (this means that running three simulations, one for
each domain and without considering the interaction between these domains,
is not enough).</p>
<p>Being able to do this will, also, let us optimize multi-domain control algorithms
that might lead to more optimal performance of buildings.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-to-model-human-behaviour"><a class="header" href="#we-need-to-model-human-behaviour">We need to model human behaviour</a></h2>
<p>People are not simple. They do not just say "it is cold, I will turn the heater on"
in a deterministic way. They take into account things like budget, bills, whether
they are alone (or they have kids, for instance) and more. Modelling this kind of
behaviour calls for a much more flexible way of modelling control algorithms (yes, I am
treating human behaviour as a control algorithm).</p>
<h2 id="we-need-to-allow-for-more-complex-control-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#we-need-to-allow-for-more-complex-control-algorithms">We need to allow for more complex control algorithms</a></h2>
<p>As hinted above, modelling human behaviour would let us model much more complex
building control algorithms. These can be stochastic, multi-domain, model-predictive-control
algorithms that aim to improve performance while maintaining an environment that people
will find acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="programs-no-longer-just-run-on-your-pc"><a class="header" href="#programs-no-longer-just-run-on-your-pc">Programs no longer just run on your PC</a></h2>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> is a modern tool, written in a modern language, and that can run in
multiple environments.</p>
<p>It can be easily compiled for Windows, Mac and Linux for running locally in your
computer. It can also be compiled into Web Assembly, which means that it can <a href="http://buildingsforpeople.org/simple_demo/">run
on a browser</a> without the need for
servers. It can also be deployed in <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless">very small and secure containers</a>
for running at scale on the cloud. It can probably (I have not tested this) be
compiled into a small computer and be implemented as an Energy Management System in
an actual building, providing insights on what the best strategy is.</p>

<p>I have been working in Building Simulation Tool space for nearly a decade now. During
this time, I have tried to combine simulation tools and methods, and also to make
simulation more accessible to people. For example, my MSc research focused on the
integration of Radiance and EnergyPlus. It was then when I started developing <a href="www.groundhoglighting.com">Groundhog</a>, which intended to put Radiance in everyone’s hands. While
developing Groundhog I realized that Radiance could use some sort of wrapper to make it a
bit friendlier by offering out-of-the-box optimizations and pre- and post-processing.
This motivated me to develop Emp, a Radiance orchestrator. Both projects—Radiance and
Emp—have already died for various reasons.</p>
<p>During my time developing building performance simulation tools I have learned about an
enormous amount of undeniable virtues that currently available tools—e.g., EnergyPlus and
Radiance—have: they have been extensively validated, they are open source, they are free
(as in freedom), and so on. Unfortunately, I have also seen many drawbacks. For starters,
these tools were not really meant to be embedded on other tools. Radiance confesses this
quite clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These routines are designed to aid the programmer who wishes to call Radiance as a
library.  Unfortunately, the system was not originally intended to be run this way, and
there are some awkward limitations to contend with…” (Radiance’s raycalls.c)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, these tools were developed decades ago. Radiance was developed before the gaming
and animation industry invested millions in improving rendering techniques, and
EnergyPlus tends to focus too much on building physics even if we now know that we need
to pay more attention to people’s behaviour in buildings (because insulating an open door
is pointless). Also, programming was different back then, with different source control
systems and way less people who knew how to code.</p>
<p><code>SIMPLE</code> attempts to fix these issues by being open-source from day zero, by using a
modern programming language, by having an architeture designed for enabling
collaboration. Don’t be mistaken, though, <code>SIMPLE</code> does not attempt to reinvent the
wheel. The real wheel is the knowledge of physics and rendering and computer sciences
behind currently existing Building Performance Simulation tools… what it proposes is to
build a good-old wheel with new materials and methods, in a more modern factory, and that
is designed to travel in modern roads.</p>
