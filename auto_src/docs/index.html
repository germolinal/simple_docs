        <h1>Welcome to the <code>SIMPLE</code> validation report</h1>
        <p>
            <code>SIMPLE</code> aims to be as reliable and transparent as
            possible. This report is a crucial piece of that effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of this report is automatically produced as part of
            <code>SIMPLE</code>'s quality control protocols. This means that a
            new version of this document is produced every time a new version of
            <code>SIMPLE</code> is deployed. Even more, several of these tests
            are required for a new version to be deployed, meaning that; if any
            change reduced accuracy, these tests should prevent that change to
            ever be deployed.

            <code>SIMPLE</code> works.
