Thanks for your interest in `SIMPLE` a simulation tool aiming to
satisfy the present needs of Building Performance Simulation. In very simple
terms, **`SIMPLE` is developed by acknowledging that current Building Science
has to see people as its first priority**.

## Structure of this repository

This repository is meant to contain the public-facing information
if any `SIMPLE` release. This include mostly documentation, but also
other artifacts, such as binaries. These are in the following libraries:

| Directory | Content | Should you edit? |
|--|--|--|
| `src` | Contains the documentation that is not derived from code (e.g., tutorials, etc.) | Yes, please |
| `auto_src` | Files coming from the actual `SIMPLE` repo (i.e., validation results and automatically-produced documentation) | NO! |
| `dist` | Binaries, mostly. I had plans to distribute SDKs but I ran out of time. | Mostly, NO... Only the examples |
